### Installation 
To install this program, it's as simple as cloning the files to your local machine.  As it stands, _**index**_ is the only root file and operates using the files in the util folder.

### Usage
To use this program, open the integrated terminal in the directory where this program is cloned to.  Run _**npm start**_ and the program will start.

### Contributions
The main purpose of this repository is to provide a great _**README**_ generator for those interested, making it easier for those that take some time creating their own.  If anyone is willing to contribute to the program, feel free to download it and create a separate branch and improve on it.  Also, feel free to get in touch with me through my email as well.

### Test Instructions
As for this repository, testing has not been implemented.  However, I plan on adding testing with Jest on the _**util**_ files in the near future.
